# React Native Push Notification Popup

[TODO] preview gif

## Features

- Support "pan" gesture
- Support "onPress" gesture feedback
- Written in pure-JS using official react-native `Animation` package
    - *Which means it supports all Expo/CRNA apps*
- Support iPhone X (yeah that notch)

## Motivations

1. In some apps, you may just want to display reminders to user, without going through those troublesome push notification setups
2. Expo/CNRA apps [cannot display push notification while app is in foreground](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v27.0.0/guides/push-notifications#notification-handling-timing)
3. Even if you eject, you still need to configure [iOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14872088/get-push-notification-while-app-in-foreground-ios) and [Android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38451235/how-to-handle-the-fire-base-notification-when-app-is-in-foreground) separately with native codes

This package is here to help. Just show your own notification popup to your users!

## Installation

```bash
yarn add react-native-push-notification-popup  # recommended
npm install react-native-push-notification-popup --save
```

## Usage

### Declare Component

Put it in a wrapper component. (Maybe where you handle your incoming push notifications)

```javascript
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <NotificationPopup ref={ref => this.popup = ref} />
        <MaybeYourNavigator />
      </View>
    );
  }
```

### Show it!

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  this.popup.show({
    onPress: function() {console.log('Pressed')},
    appIconSource: require('./assets/icon.jpg'),
    appTitle: 'Some App',
    timeText: 'Now',
    title: 'Hello World',
    body: 'This is a sample message.\nTesting emoji ðŸ˜€',
  });
}
```
